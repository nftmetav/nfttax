              "If you sold an NFT, you have to pay taxes; if you bought and sold
              an NFT, you have to pay taxes; and if you just bought an NFTâ€¦ you
              have to pay taxes."

              "In the US, you have to evaluate every transaction at the time of
              trading, both 1) from crypto to USD and also 2) from crypto to
              crypto. If you realize a capital gain, you have to pay taxes on
              it."

              "In summary, it doesn't matter if the transaction is to USD or to
              crypto. All it matters is the price when you bought and sold the
              asset."
